# Fetcher Starwind compatibility patch

This release overlays the Fetcher-maintained Starwind vanilla and multiplayer compatibility files without modifying the Nexus archive installed by UMO.

Version 2 also quarantines Starwind's root menu, cursor, scroll, and book UI textures outside the active data paths. This keeps Starwind world assets available while preventing its total-conversion UI skin from leaking into the shared vanilla multiplayer login and game interface.

`Textures/JMenuScreen.dds` is intentionally retained because `meshes/ig/activators/datapad.nif` uses it for the blue in-world datapad screen. Patch 2.0.1 restores it from older Fetcher quarantine directories when necessary.

Patch 2.0.1 also supplies the animation companions for all 21 creature models that `StarwindRemasteredV1.15.esm` relocates beneath `Meshes/starwind_compat/r`. OpenMW resolves external creature animations relative to the model directory, so relocating only the NIFs caused creatures such as the Mykal, Bolotaur, and Varactyl to translate through the world in static poses. The imperfect Fabricant's missing `x` model companion is included as well. Release builds validate every required companion by SHA-256.

Patch 2.1 relocates Starwind's standard `Music/Battle`, `Music/Explore`, and `Music/Special` overrides into the isolated `Music/Starwind` namespace at install time. This restores Morrowind's title music at the main menu and lets the bundled OpenMW Lua router select Starwind music only for cells owned by `StarwindRemasteredPatch.esm`. Outside those cells, the router combines the normal Morrowind explore/battle directories with any additional namespaced explore/battle tracks supplied by projects such as Tamriel Rebuilt or Project Cyrodiil.

Patch 2.1.1 restricts Starwind's generic Czerka guard greeting to the private Czerka faction, restores Morrowind's vanilla level-up sound, and permanently deletes the vanilla rock reference that obstructs the `coc "Suran"` arrival point.

The patch is portable. Its applier receives the tester installation root and discovered Starwind data root as parameters; it contains no machine-specific paths. Installation is staged and swapped into `Data Files/fetcher-starwind-compat`, with payload sizes and SHA-256 hashes verified before any existing patch is replaced.

For testers migrating from the previously published updater, the install root can also be discovered by walking upward from the UMO-managed Starwind data directory. The release includes the legacy manifest alias expected by that updater and regenerates `openmw.cfg` after applying the overlay, so the first `Update-Fetcher-Simulator.bat` run completes the migration.

Build a release archive from the compatibility project's `build` directory:

  -OutputDirectory C:\path\to\release-output `
  -PatchVersion 2.1.1 `
  -SourceCommit 7070c4f

Only the final `StarwindRemasteredV1.15.esm`, `StarwindRemasteredPatch.esm`, and `Starwind Vanilla Compat` overlay are packaged. Numbered intermediate ESM build artifacts are excluded.
